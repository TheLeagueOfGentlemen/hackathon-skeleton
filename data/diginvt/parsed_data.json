We had no idea that we would become farmers but one cow changed our lives forever. Starting out as back-to-the-landers, to full blown dairy farmers, to B&B hosts and diversified farmers, the many twist and turns in our farming career have led us back to milking four lovely Jersey cows once again.Our guests love this place and appreciate the fact that we share our lifestyle with them. They write in our guest book that we are friendly and warm, our farm raised food for our breakfasts, exceptional, and conversations enjoyable and interesting. Folks feel that they learn and share a lot while they are here. Once you are in Vermont and stay at our farm, you will experience a gentler way of living on this planet. We hope that this feeling will stay in your thoughts and hearts for a long time to come. We invite you to visit this place we call home.First opened in 2001, we started offering for sale our own naturally/organically raised Beefalo beef, pork, chickens, turkeys, eggs and maple syrup. All 100% anti-biotic and hormone-free products and produced right here at our farm. Folks from all over the area came and enjoyed our products, these were the early days of the localvore movement.  Our customers and especially the kids love being on the farm and visiting with the animals. Our animals are raised with the utmost of care and respect. They have a happy, healthy life while they are here at Hollister Hill Farm.In 2009 we had the opportunity to expand the farm store. Not only did we make it bigger but we made it more energy efficient. We are now selling organic vegetables and berries from Lee\u2019s garden as well. But, the most wonderful part of this opportunity, we were able to start milking a few cows again. Many of our customers when asked if they would be interested in buying raw milk from us were very enthusiastic. So, we added a milk room/dairy equipment and bought four lovely Jersey cows. Having dairy cows on our farm again makes our farm feel complete.You now have the opportunity to be a localvore yourself.

In fact, more sheep are milked than any other animal worldwide, and some of the world's best cheeses - like Roquefort, Manchego, and Pecorino Romano - are made from the milk of sheep, not cows or goats. The making of sheep's milk cheese migrated to the United States only within the last 25 years, with Vermont farms being the most dedicated crafters. Vermont has earned a reputation for its award-winning cheeses, commitment to all-natural foods, and dogged pursuit of quality. Put these three factors together and you describe the Woodcock Farm Cheese Company. Situated just outside the historic village of Weston in the Green Mountains of Vermont, cheesemakers Mark and Gari Fischer have crafted a select variety of artisanal cheese from farm-fresh sheep's milk. We pride ourselves on the flavor and texture of the cheeses we lovingly create and tend throughout the year.In keeping with the age-old tradition, our flock of East Friesian sheep - a breed highly regarded by cheesemakers - graze on 45 acres of lush organic pastures.

The property has been in our family since the late 1700\u2019s and different generations of Halls have been cultivating apples and pears since the orchard was started. From 1828 until 2005 when the matriarch of the family, Mina Hall, passed away these generations of Halls have lived in the family farm house. The house is one of the historic stone houses built by the Scottish stone mason, James Ritchie. The stone in the house was quarried on the island and ancient coral reef fossils can be found in them.In an effort to help keep the orchard in the family and operating successfully Steve and Carol Hall Stata began restoring the family farm house and in 2008 started a seasonal caf\u00e9. The Caf\u00e9 is in a renovated carriage barn attached to the house.Building on the success of the Caf\u00e9, in 2009 we decided to experiment with making Ice Cider.  We made 3 different varieties, all of which were delicious. The response was immediate and we quickly sold everything we had produced and we began making plans for expansion. In 2010 we tripled production and added a fourth variety. 2011 found us tripling again and adding a fifth variety.With the increase production we quickly outgrew our original facilities. In 2011 we completed the restoration of the fruit house, located on the other side of the main house opposite the Cafe. As with many things on an old farm the fruit house had been used for many activities including the storage and packing of apples and for living quarters for at least one set of grandparents. It now is climate controlled and houses both the press equipment and fermentation/aging equipment. The lab and bottling room along with the tasting room are in the main farm house.The Ice Cider is available at the Cidery, many farmers markets in the area, a number of stores throughout Grand Isle, Franklin and Chittenden counties, many wine tasting events through the state and special tasting events help at the Cidery.We also have a very nice apple table wine and Hard Cider.

The first trees were planted in 2005 and we are still planting! Designed as a pick-your-own orchard, the trees are planted so that several varieties of apples are within a short walking distance and branches are kept low so that picking is easy. With over 35 varieties there are many choices. Great views of the surrounding Cabot hillside farms and the Green Mountains, plenty of open space for walking and picnics, and people who enjoy simple fun round out the rest of the experience at our orchard."}, "http://www.diginvt.com/places/detail/nordic-center-at-strafford-organic-creamery": {"town": "Strafford", "website": "http://straffordnordicskiing.com/", "name": "Nordic Center at Strafford Organic Creamery", "zipcode": "05072", "hours": "9am-4pm", "phone": "802-765-4309", "state": "VT", "address": "61 Rockbottom Rd.", "seasons": ["Winter"], "email": "info@straffordnordicskiing.com", "categories": ["Farm Visits"], "description": "The Strafford Nordic Center is Vermont's newest premier cross-country skiing center located in Strafford, Vermont.Our initial  trail system is the backbone for a proposed 50 kilometer trail system being created on two locally owned well known farms.
