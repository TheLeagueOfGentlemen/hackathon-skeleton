Maybe one of the best decisions you\u2019ll make this year is to stay at our Bed and Breakfast and visit our farm.Vermont is truly a special place and one of the things that make it so special is its working landscape. We had no idea that we would become farmers but one cow changed our lives forever. Starting out as back-to-the-landers, to full blown dairy farmers, to B&B hosts and diversified farmers, the many twist and turns in our farming career have led us back to milking four lovely Jersey cows once again.Our guests love this place and appreciate the fact that we share our lifestyle with them. They write in our guest book that we are friendly and warm, our farm raised food for our breakfasts, exceptional, and conversations enjoyable and interesting. Folks feel that they learn and share a lot while they are here. Once you are in Vermont and stay at our farm, you will experience a gentler way of living on this planet. We hope that this feeling will stay in your thoughts and hearts for a long time to come. We invite you to visit this place we call home.First opened in 2001, we started offering for sale our own naturally\/organically raised Beefalo beef, pork, chickens, turkeys, eggs and maple syrup. All 100% anti-biotic and hormone-free products and produced right here at our farm. Folks from all over the area came and enjoyed our products, these were the early days of the localvore movement.  Our customers and especially the kids love being on the farm and visiting with the animals. Our animals are raised with the utmost of care and respect. They have a happy, healthy life while they are here at Hollister Hill Farm.In 2009 we had the opportunity to expand the farm store. Not only did we make it bigger but we made it more energy efficient. We are now selling organic vegetables and berries from Lee\u2019s garden as well. But, the most wonderful part of this opportunity, we were able to start milking a few cows again. Many of our customers when asked if they would be interested in buying raw milk from us were very enthusiastic. So, we added a milk room\/dairy equipment and bought four lovely Jersey cows. Having dairy cows on our farm again makes our farm feel complete.You now have the opportunity to be a localvore yourself. At our farm you will find small farm raised food at fair prices.Our store is open daily 9am-5pm.",

            "description": "We are a micro-orchard serving the city of Vergennes and all surrounding towns in northern Addison County. The trees were planted in 2002 focusing on a pick-your-own concept with low scaffold branches to make it easy for small family members to pick. The orchard has over 250 trees to choose from including several popular varieties - Honeycrisp, McIntosh, Empire, Cortland, Macoun, Liberty, Redfree, Rome and Sweet 16. All trees receive pesticide sprays following weekly guidance from the University of Vermont and Cornell University using the latest Integrated Pest Managements practices. This practice requires monitoring both fungus and insect activity within the orchard. We then use a very conservative approach to correct a problem if it exceeds specific economic thresholds. We hope that you will enjoy our orchard as much as we do, and don\u2019t forget to buy local.",

The northern most point of Route 100 can be found about 4 miles southwest of Lake Memphremagog.Brian and Jenn Cook created Kingdom Brewing with the intent to brew terrific craft beers from a wide variety of locally produced ingredients.  Starting with American grown grains, they add locally produced ingredients such as maple sap, spruce tips or apples to create a variety of light to robust seasonal beers.In addition to their homegrown philosophy, the Cooks run Kingdom Brewing in the most environmentally friendly way possible. One common problem for many brewers is finding a way to dispose of the mash left over from the brewing process. The Black Angus beef herd on the Cook\u2019s farm happily dispose of the spent grains for them. Additionally, the brewery uses a geo-thermal type of fermentation cooling system.See what\u2019s brewing on Facebook!",

In addition to using fruits from our own orchards and groves, we support other Vermont farms and orchards by purchasing their fruits. We use organically grown produce whenever possible.Over the seventeen years that we have been producing wine, our wines have won regional, national and international awards. While focusing on fruits that grow easily in Vermont, we produce wines that are not overly sweet.  Limiting the sweetness brings out more of the natural flavors of the fruit. All wines are allowed to age at least nine months before bottling. Our Grape wines are often aged one to two years. We use no oak barrels or oak chips to avoid masking the true flavors.  The one exception to our production of fruit wines which are not overly sweet is our new Pear Ice Wine.  Like any ice wine the intenseness of the fruit is brought out in the natural freezing process, resulting in a delightful sweet dessert wine.Spring, summer and fall come off the beaten path. Enjoy our rural setting with 50-mile views. Bring a lunch to enjoy with a selected wine while sitting outside soaking up the views, flower gardens and tranquility.Or visit our Retail Shop and Tasting Room on Route 100, Waterbury Center, at the Cold Hollow Cider Mill.

Live music is available nearly every evening Thursday \u2013 Saturday. Our mission is to attract many different musical genres, never falling into a niche by type of music.

            "description": "For centuries, the Europeans have enjoyed the distinctive flavor of cheeses made from sheep's milk. In fact, more sheep are milked than any other animal worldwide, and some of the world's best cheeses - like Roquefort, Manchego, and Pecorino Romano - are made from the milk of sheep, not cows or goats. The making of sheep's milk cheese migrated to the United States only within the last 25 years, with Vermont farms being the most dedicated crafters. Vermont has earned a reputation for its award-winning cheeses, commitment to all-natural foods, and dogged pursuit of quality. Put these three factors together and you describe the Woodcock Farm Cheese Company. Situated just outside the historic village of Weston in the Green Mountains of Vermont, cheesemakers Mark and Gari Fischer have crafted a select variety of artisanal cheese from farm-fresh sheep's milk. We pride ourselves on the flavor and texture of the cheeses we lovingly create and tend throughout the year.In keeping with the age-old tradition, our flock of East Friesian sheep - a breed highly regarded by cheesemakers - graze on 45 acres of lush organic pastures. This healthy diet gives the cheese its rich, buttery flavor. We collect the milk in the morning and add rennet to produce the curds, which form the basis for the many types of cheese produced here at Woodcock Farm.",

Our beers are made with pure Vermont water, the best imported and domestic malts and hops, and quality yeasts. Nothing else is added and we take nothing away!At Trout River Brewing, we believe that the naturally occuring settling of unfiltered brews results in a more flavorful and complex taste. As well, filtration robs the aroma which is a very important part of the beer experience. Therefore, we do not filter our beers!",

The property has been in our family since the late 1700\u2019s and different generations of Halls have been cultivating apples and pears since the orchard was started. From 1828 until 2005 when the matriarch of the family, Mina Hall, passed away these generations of Halls have lived in the family farm house. The house is one of the historic stone houses built by the Scottish stone mason, James Ritchie. The stone in the house was quarried on the island and ancient coral reef fossils can be found in them.In an effort to help keep the orchard in the family and operating successfully Steve and Carol Hall Stata began restoring the family farm house and in 2008 started a seasonal caf\u00e9. The Caf\u00e9 is in a renovated carriage barn attached to the house.Building on the success of the Caf\u00e9, in 2009 we decided to experiment with making Ice Cider.  We made 3 different varieties, all of which were delicious. The response was immediate and we quickly sold everything we had produced and we began making plans for expansion. In 2010 we tripled production and added a fourth variety. 2011 found us tripling again and adding a fifth variety.With the increase production we quickly outgrew our original facilities. In 2011 we completed the restoration of the fruit house, located on the other side of the main house opposite the Cafe. As with many things on an old farm the fruit house had been used for many activities including the storage and packing of apples and for living quarters for at least one set of grandparents. It now is climate controlled and houses both the press equipment and fermentation\/aging equipment. The lab and bottling room along with the tasting room are in the main farm house.The Ice Cider is available at the Cidery, many farmers markets in the area, a number of stores throughout Grand Isle, Franklin and Chittenden counties, many wine tasting events through the state and special tasting events help at the Cidery.We also have a very nice apple table wine and Hard Cider. Both are made from the same sweet cider concentrate used in making our Ice Cider.",

It is created by the Ielpi Major family, who pasture and milk the sheep, make and age the cheese on their 250 acre farm in Westminster West, Vermont. Vermont Shepherd's quality and flavor are a reflection of the wholesome way the family attempts to farm - only using milk from the sheep that graze the healthy, wild pastures, and then treating the milk with care, not pumping or heating too fast. The family makes Vermont Shepherd Cheese in 10 to 30 wheel batches, 3 days a week during grazing season. Because sheep milk is so high in protein, the fat content of Vermont Shepherd Cheese is similar to a low fat cheddar, and, being made of pasture milk, the cheese is especially high in beneficial fatty acids.",
