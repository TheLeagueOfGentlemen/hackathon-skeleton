    "description": "Bolton Valley sits high in the Green Mountains of Vermont. It is a unique, high mountain alpine village surrounded by over 5,000 pristine acres. At Bolton Valley the recreational opportunities are as numerous as the views are spectacular. Whether your interest is skiing or snowboarding, telemark or Nordic, backcountry or night skiing or just a relaxing snowshoe in the woods, Bolton Valley has it all in abundance.\nBolton Valley offers 70 trails and glades for Alpine skiing and riding and 100km of Nordic and backcountry trails. Each year Bolton Valley receives an average of 312 inches of snow.\nBolton Valley is a self contained, family friendly resort focused on providing excellent value to skiers and riders All the lodging, including hotel rooms, suites and condominiums are either ski in/ski out or within a short walking distance of the lifts. Two restaurants, a cafeteria, deli and general store are conveniently located within the village. The base lodge and rental shop are ski-in ski-out for your convenience. After a great day on the slopes, relax in the Sports Center's Jacuzzi, heated pool or warm up in the sauna. So park your car and forget about it during your stay, everything you need is all right here.\nThis is the place to get away and enjoy the best Vermont has to offer. If you are looking to learn the basics of a new winter sport or expand your skills in one you already participate in, the Bolton Valley Ski and Snowboard School is the place for you. The school offers a wide array of lessons tailored to everyone from kids to adults and beginners to advances skiers and riders.\nAt Bolton Valley, we are conscious about our environmental footprint and are blessed to have nature\u2019s playground at our doorstep. Taking care of it is a no-brainer. As the recipient of the National Ski Areas Association\u2019s 2010 Silver Eagle Award for environmental initiative we continuously look for ways to be more energy efficient. From being one of only two ski resorts in the U.S. to implement wind power as an energy source to using biodegradable and recyclable products throughout the cafeteria and restaurants, We strive to keep our environmental footprint as small as possible. Bolton Valley\u2019s snowmaking is \u201cgreen\u201d through energy efficient HKD snowguns and SMI fan guns to reduce diesel and electric power consumption. We reduce our fossil fuel consumption for heating the base lodge with two Magnum Countryside pellet stoves through our partnership with Energy Co-op of Vermont. Recycling stations throughout the resort, as well as an environmental towel program in the hotel and the use of safe snowmelt on sidewalks are just a few of the small ways that help to make a big environmental impact."

Just out from the ski center are 10 km of gentle \u201cmeadow\u201d skiing that connect to our fitness center and the 20 km of woodland trails on Mt. Peg. There are also 30 km of trails located across the village green on Mt. Tom \u2013 and these quite often become the favorites of those who discover them. Skiing or snowshoeing Mt. Tom puts you on century old carriage roads in the midst of Vermont\u2019s first tree farm and Vermont\u2019s first National Park site. An outing through these woodlands and to our log cabin warming hut is truly an extraordinary experience. Enjoy an escape in Woodstock this winter with your family or friends. The skiing, and all else that Woodstock offers, should delight in pleasant memories and a desire to return again and again. Happy Trails!"

    "description": "What is it about Mad River Glen? Why is Mad River Glen on the MUST ski list for any skiers worth their salt? There are plenty of areas that are bigger, steeper, and offer more amenities. There are certainly plenty of places that get more reliable snow. So what is it that makes Mad River Glen the iconic \u201choly grail\u201d for so many skiers?\nIt\u2019s a combination of many things and for every skier the answer is a little different. Mad River Glen offers the most challenging and diverse terrain in New England with an uphill capacity that guarantees low skier density on the trails even on the busiest days. It is one of the last bastions of natural snow skiing in New England and is one of only three areas in North America that prohibit snowboarding. The trails were cut to follow the mountain\u2019s natural contours. Skiers can descend the entire 2,037' of vertical on true expert terrain with absolutely no run-outs. On the other hand, Mad River\u2019s mountain layout with a single base area makes it an ideal family mountain. The area\u2019s character, the result of a long and proud history, reflects the terrain and natural beauty. There is a special camaraderie among the skiing community, with its co-op ownership, non-commercial, family-friendly atmosphere, dedicated staff, and - of course- the Single Chair, America\u2019s favorite ski lift.\nCombined, these qualities create a unique ski experience that stands in stark contrast to the mainstream world of skiing.\u00a0 The various facets of the Mad River ski experience appeal to different skiers in different ways but together they create a feeling and sense of place that is truly unique.\u00a0 The mission of the Mad River Glen Cooperative is to protect and preserve these special qualities. The skier-owners of Mad River Glen invite you to discover for yourself the experience they are dedicated to preserving."

So we\u2019ve foregone wider, flatter trails, and the wider, flatter skiers they cater to, for trails and glades that respect the mountain\u2019s natural contours. And we don\u2019t rate tough blues as blacks or anything close to a green as a blue. Up North, you earn it. Not everybody gets a trophy, a mentality we observed watching more than 50 Olympians learn to be great at the world-renowned Burke Mountain Academy. But we want to exclude no one. So if you can\u2019t ski or ride any of our 50 trails or 100+ acres of glades, we\u2019ll teach you. After all, we believe everyone should, at least once, experience what Vermont skiing and riding\u2013the True North experience\u2013was all about. And, in one place, at least, still is.
